## Downloading Workshop Materials

\

Thank you for joining us. Today, we are going to run through three exercises related to data visualization. To begin, open a Terminal session and enter the following commands:

<pre class="bash"><code>#Change directories to your Desktop
cd Desktop

#Download workshop materials with wget
wget http://dbsloan.github.io/csb2017/csb2017.zip

#Unzip the workshop materials
unzip csb2017.zip
</code></pre>


Alternatively, you can [download the workshop materials directly from this link](csb2017.zip).

\

Now let's enter a couple commands that will make things run more smoothly on the lab computers we are using for today's workshop.

<pre class="bash"><code>#This will give us an easily accessible link on the Desktop to run RStudio, which we will use in the first two exercises.
ln -s /usr/local/rstudio/bin/rstudio

#And this will add BLAST executables and Circos to your PATH, so you don't have to provide the full path each time you call the programs.
echo PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/circos/bin:/usr/local/blast/bin >> ~/.bashrc

#relaunch bash for the PATH updates to take effect
bash
</code></pre>
